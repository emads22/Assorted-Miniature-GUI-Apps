# Assorted Miniature GUI Apps

## Overview
Assorted Miniature GUI Apps is a collection of four small-scale graphical user interface (GUI) applications developed using PyQT6 and Streamlit. These apps serve various purposes, including file compression, archive extraction, measurement conversion, and webcam image capture with grayscale conversion.

## Features
- **File Compressor**: This application compresses files and folders into a single ZIP archive, featuring a fast and efficient compression algorithm.
- **Archive Extractor**: Designed to extract files and folders from ZIP archives, this app offers a simple interface for easy extraction.
- **Meter Converter**: Users can convert measurements between feet (inches) and meters using this app, which features a simple and intuitive user interface.
- **Webcam App**: Enables users to capture images using their webcam. It provides options to capture pictures and convert them to grayscale automatically, as well as browse for existing images on the device and convert them to grayscale.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
3. Navigate to each app directory and run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Each application includes both a Python script (`.py` file) and an executable file (`.exe`). You can run the application by either:
   - Executing the Python script directly using the command:
     ```
     python <script-name>.py
     ```
     Replace `<script-name>` with the actual name of the Python script file.
   - Running the executable file by double-clicking on it or executing it from the terminal/command prompt.
   - For the webcam app, execute the command `streamlit run webcam_app.py` in the terminal.

## Usage
- Each application can be run independently by executing its respective executable file.
